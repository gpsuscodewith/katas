### Prerequisites

 * Web Browser
 * Download software from: [https://someurl/software](https://someurl/software)

### Steps

Configure the thing
1. First, find and navigate to the vetting questions on SharePoint (source of truth)
2. Note the structure of the questions list. (The list shouldn't be modified or edited. Treat it as read-only)
3. Get link to vetting tool [http://aka.ms/gpscodewithvet] (http://aka.ms/gpscodewithvet) and launch it
4. Bookmark the vetting tool
5. Open [partner scenario] (https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/OCPCodewithAlphaTeam/EZ0X_Lg_2B9Eigmg0Z_UyK0BVSiavTEF7p9tOY5tRlQMQg?e=ueCLIR)
6. Based on scenario, answer each question up to the time limit
7. Submit questions
8. Stop

1 minute: Share results of "approve" or "knockout" the partner

Reflect (example questions)
* Do you think you were able to properly qualify the partner?
* How can we improve? 
* Ways to improve or change the goal?

### Reflections

Session 2 

* Unknown to a lot of things from the scenario and would require PTS
* Skipped sharepoint list
* Survey, sliders (duration) unit of numbers, slider for resources but slider didn't move
* Didn't get through all the vetting questions. Some of the questions were similar and answering the same way
* Opportunity for consolidation of questions
* Scenario was vague
* Survey: the explanation boxes were overwhelming
* Question alignment

Session 2 Feedback

* Good potential: questions weren't overwhelming, low burden
* Questions like "when is this going to be on Azure" were to the point
* Search for the partner would make it easier (or search isn't obvious)
* Questions without the explanation boxes are greatly simplifying / streamlining
* Beginning of each question is repetitive "the partnerâ€¦" or "the project", making it harder to quickly determine the question
* Some of the questions can be combined (like read/write access to source control)
* Very subjective
